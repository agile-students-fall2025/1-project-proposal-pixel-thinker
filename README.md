# Engage 2.0
<span style="font-size: 20px;">Our goal is to bring community to campus in a more effective way.</span>


## What and why?

We want to build Engage 2.0, a platform that helps NYU students discover and connect with clubs/organizations across campus, most importantly, find live updates of events happening on the NYC campus. Many students struggle to find groups that fit their interests, or they only hear about opportunities through word of mouth or scattered channels. 

Our application solves this problem by providing a central, intuitive hub where students can explore clubs, see live events, and engage with communities that match their interests. Through the success of our application, we are bringing more connection and community onto campus. It doesn't just stop there, it provides opportunities for people from different goals (social, professional, academic) to find like-minded people and a purpose.

## For whom?
This is an internal NYU project. This application is made by students, designed for students. Specifically, we aim to find community within the New York City NYU campus. All clubs are invited to use this platform, whether from Tandon or CAS or SAB.


## How?
From a student's perspective, Engage 2.0 will be able to:

1. Create a personalized feed of clubs & events based on a student's interests.
2. Allow students to browse and filter a large selection of campus clubs.
3. Easily enable clubs to share their marketing materials for their events.
4. Offer students a system to RSVP and keep track of attendance.
5. Find a way to promote user engagement, how can we keep them checking regularly on this application?

## Scope
The front-end and back-end is feasible for a team of 4-6 programmers. Only risks of this project:
1. Finding a complete lists of current NYU clubs & organizations.
2. Storing user data and executing personalized results.
3. Introducing a way to promote user engagement.

This project should be feasible for a team of 6 depending on how they plan their MVP. Taking inspiration off of the original Engage page is also an option, rather than restarting a brand new application.
